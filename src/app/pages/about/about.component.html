            About Me
        </div>
        <div class="card-body" style="z-index: 1;">
            My name is Kevin Medzorian, and I'm a recent computer science graduate from UC San Diego. I have a natural aspiration for computer science, and enjoy living and learning in the world of computing.
            <br>
            I have an extensive background in software development, dating back to my early childhood - learning to code with just a laptop and the internet. I have extensive industry and academic experience as a software developer, and I have many hobbies such as web and video game design.
            <br>
            Furthermore, I have a passion for higher-tier education, and graduated with a bachelor's of science in computer science at the University of California - San Diego, where I have participated in many undergraduate research opportunities (YonderDeep) and hackathons (like SD Hacks).
